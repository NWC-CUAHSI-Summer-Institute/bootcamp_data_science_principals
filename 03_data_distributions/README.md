# Data distributions
In this lesson we will go through the CAMELS data and explore their distributions

#### basin_attribute_distributions.ipynb
This file contains examples of ways to check the probability distributions of our data.
* plot histogram of the data
* get statistical moments from our data
* use those statistics to create synthetic (normally distributed) data
* test a hypothesis about the normality of the data
* plot the probability and cumulative probability distributions
* plot join probability distributions of two basin attributes
