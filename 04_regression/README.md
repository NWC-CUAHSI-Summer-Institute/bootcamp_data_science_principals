# Regression
In this lesson we will use CAMELS data to build regression models to make predictions across CONUS

#### regression_models.ipynb
* Solve a least squares regression
* Inspect USGS regression equations to estimate streamflow recurrence intervals
* Use Random Forest Regression to estimate CONUS-wide streamflow recurrence intervals from basin attributes
